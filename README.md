# Xenomai on rPi

## Step by step guide on how to experience the glory of xenomai on your rPi

## [Chapter 0: A new beginning - Prerequisites](https://github.com/George117/rpi-kernel-compile/issues/3)
## [Chapter 1: What about dependencies?](https://github.com/George117/rpi-kernel-compile/issues/4)
## [Chapter 2: A manual journey - patch the kernel with Cobalt](https://github.com/George117/rpi-kernel-compile/issues/5)
## [Chapter 3: Are we there yet? Install xenomai on rPi](https://github.com/George117/rpi-kernel-compile/issues/6)




These steps were tested on a Raspberry Pi Compute module 4 and eventually Xenomai and Cobalt were running on this hardware.
