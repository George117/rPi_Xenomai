### Step by step guide on how to experience the glory of xenomai on your rPi
### NB: Even though this guide treats 32bit and 64bit you should use the 64bit, it needs no workarounds or other shady things to do. It just works :) 


These steps were tested on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 starting from Raspbian Lite 64bit.
