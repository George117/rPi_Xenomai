# Xenomai on rPi

## Step by step guide on how to experience the glory of xenomai on your rPi
## NB: Even though this guide treats 32bit and 64bit you should use the 64bit, it needs no workarounds or other shady things to do. It just works :) 

## [Chapter 0: A new beginning - Prerequisites](chapter_0.md)
## [Chapter 1: What about dependencies?](chapter_1.md)
## [Chapter 2: A manual journey - patch the kernel with Cobalt](chapter_2.md)
## [Chapter 3: Are we there yet? Install xenomai on rPi](chapter_3.md)




These steps were tested on a Raspberry Pi Compute module 4 and eventually Xenomai and Cobalt were running on this hardware.
